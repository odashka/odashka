## Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate and dedicated BI Developer with 2 years of experience in the field.
- 💻 Currently working on various projects to gain new skills in Data Engineering.
- 🔎 Eager to expand my skills in data architecture, pipeline development, and big data technologies.

When I'm not diving into data, I enjoy:

- 📚 Reading of both fiction and non-fiction.
- 🏞 Exploring the great outdoors and staying active.
- 🧘 Practicing mindfulness and maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
